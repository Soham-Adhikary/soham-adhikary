    <h1 class="mb-4">Short Story: Who Holds The Thread?</h1>

    <div class="card p-4">
        <p>The loom led out a long, weary sigh, slumping his shoulders. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and he wiped it with the back of his hand. The weaver’s fingers pulled thread into a sari so thin, it looked like almost dawn had spun it. The notification buzzed - another EMI alert. He scrolled past loan apps, then returned to his reel: “ASMR - Handloom Sari Making.” His daughter's wedding was tomorrow. The wedding shari he was working on shimmered under the LED bulb, its gold threads trembling like the tears of artisans woven into its fabric, each shimmering a silent question of who to hold accountable for their toil. The single, bare bulb highlighted the cracks that spiderwebbed across the plater, revealing a faded photograph of an old lady. Now, her voice lived only in the coughs, a daily companion since she left, that shook their small, rented rooms.</p>
        
        <p>Outside, a brown SUV idled near the gate. The landlord’s man came yesterday, “Two days,” he said. The weaver silently nodded, then went back to his loom, the distant shouts from the highway protest being drowned out by its rhythmic clack. That night, he finished the final stitch.</p>
        
        <p>The sari was lighter than a breath and then he ran his fingers along the edge. “Neither protected nor.. or.. suffocated.” He sat and murmured to no one.</p>
        
        <p>At dawn, his daughter found him. The sari hung from the ceiling fan, motionless in the thick air, cradling his neck like a mother's arm. Outside, the landlord's man arrived, paused at the threshold. After a moment, without a word, he stepped back and closed the door behind him. On the street, a vendor called out, selling strings of fragmented tuberose for the morning temple crowds. The sari was yanked down later. It tore without a sound.</p>
