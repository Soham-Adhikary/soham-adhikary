    <p>Amidst the constant humming of a city and the calm of a village, there existed a school, acting as a bridge between these two words, decided to introduce a new experiment. The administration, motivated by a noble yet untested ambition, came up with an "Empathy pill" that is supposed to foster harmony, understanding, affection, and empathy among young minds. They felt it would be the best way, which would be a quick fix to solve all the problems by fixing emotions, to medicate the problem away. </p>
   
    

   

  <p>Among these students was Avan a thoughtful boy with deep brown skin, tuft defining his curls, and a dimple hiding his nose, who often stayed lost in the pages of books, Mrig, his friend, whose laughter would echo through the corridors, and Medha, a girl with very quiet yet sharp eyes. When the day came, most students were eagerly waiting to swallow the pills, some of them, carrying different purposes than what meets the eye. Some of the students, however, as their parents warned them, abstained. Avan was one of them. Avan was not upset. But while he was in the classroom, he started to feel like an outsider, rather isolated. The classroom. once alive with students shouting, laughing, and doodling on textbooks, now felt like a prayer ceremony at a funeral. Everybody was relating with everybody now, no fuss, nowhere. Amidst this, Avan feels like he could hear himself breathing heavily and strictly watching himself to not make any silly behaviors. 
</p>


 <p>One day, as he sat on a break, he noticed Mrig approaching.  All of his friends seem like they are carrying the burden of everyone's weight. Mrig, as he sat down, his cricket scar catching the sunlight as he tilted his head. "Tumne pill nahi liya, na?" he asked. Avan shook his head, "Nah. Nahi liya." Mrig sighed, gazing distant, "Kaash maine bhi na liya hota. Samajh nahi aa raha kaise samjhaoon." Mrig, black hair-ed, had always been the life of the classroom, embraced the pill with open arms while wondering how it would affect him. His laughter, once loud and carefree, now carried all sorts of understanding. He could now feel what his classmate's inner silent struggles were, and he started to laugh more this time, but the joyfulness and the nonchalant were missing. And slowly, while trying to help others, Mrig started to lose himself. His identity was no more 'his identity., it has now blurred away, now mixed into shared emotions of the school.  He felt himself fading as he sat alone on the concrete under the tree. In class, the more he tried to help others, the more he felt afterward like he no longer knew what he wanted, what he felt, or even who he was.  

</p>



<p>
Medha had always been observant with her sharp eyes, and flowing dark curls, usually left freely, were now pulled back tightly, making her face look thin and tired like he survived a siege. She seemed to see everything beyond the surface, the type of girl who would notice every flicker of emotions in the teacher's face. Her eyes, usually warm, held the cold. 'Winter is not coming,' she said in her mind gazing down, 'it is here. Ravens are here not for the news, but for the commands.’ She took the pill, with all of these thoughts. And gradually she found herself to be drowning in the emotions her classmates were feeling. She used to have a clear vision, but not anymore now. She would often begin to withdraw, her gaze fixed on the world outside, as she leaned on her hands, placed on the bench, as if searching for something she had lost. As weeks turned into months, the lines between their selves and others began to look like a blurred area, which they couldn't distinguish anymore. Like a slow and subtle shift, the clear distinct line between their selves and their thoughts became less sharp. It's like they can't distinguish, they can't differentiate as all of their differences seem hazy to each other. 


</p>


    
    <p>One afternoon, as the sun almost looks like setting, Avan, Mrig, and Medha find themselves together. Earlier that afternoon, the retirement ceremony of Mr. Anukool had just happened. "Ye Pill akhir hamare liye kyun chahiye?"Avan spoke first, looking at his friends. "Agar feelings dil se naturally aayein, woh behtar nahi hai?" Mrig, with a mix of emotions, replied, Kyun nahi, lekin jo itne din se kisi mein aaye hi nahi, woh aa jaye toh behtar hi lagta hai. Yeh uss khidki ki tarah hai,” pointing to the nearby window, “hum ek dusre ko dekh sakte hain." Through it, they could see the school pond shimmering, beautiful from afar, but bitter smell up close.



</p>
    
    

    <p>
Medha, her gaze distant, added, "At what cost? "Hum sab is sab ke chakkar mein apne aap se door hote ja rahe hain, dekha? Kaun jaane, ve bhi hamare liye wohi empathy kab dikhayenge, ya phir, hum hi dikhate reh jaayenge?" The three fell silent, each lost in their thoughts. Meanwhile, Ramadhin sir had been strolling through the schoolyard with the peon, Ratnakar, while arguing about the school's policy and why they would not allow people who are homeless to seek shelter within its walls during various harsh seasons. He was known for his absurdity and knowledge in school. He believed that even if it was done by bending a few rules, the school had a moral obligation towards those who were helpless. This seemed to have made Ratnakar visibly flustered. Having seen the students, he slowly approached them.

</p>


    <p>"Sir," Avan asked, curious, "Ye pills school ne humein kyun diye vaise? Side effects agar nahi hain, toh hamare andar kaisa change aayega?" Ramadhin nodded, his eyes showing his deep thoughts and awaiting the reactions of the students."Beta, jahan aapke beech time aur attention ki itni kami hai, yeh ek aisa tareeka hai shayad understanding laane ka." He continued after observing everyone's face and gazing his look at the walls, "Dawaiyaan hamein ek dusre ko sunna, samajhna, shanti se paas baithna, agreements aur disagreements handle karna nahi sikhaayengi. Natural practices hamein sirf dusron ko samajhna hi nahi, balki khud ko samajhna bhi sikhaate hain." Medha indulged in, "Par sir, hum sab pills khaake agar same tareeke se operate karein toh, hum ek doosre ko kaise pehchanenge?" Ramadhin smiled, keeping his fists and holding the balcony with it, "What an intriguing thought," he continued, "Same hona shayad sab sahi lage, lekin bhai, what about the beauty in differences? Innovation kahaan jaayegi? Aur hamari originality?"
 
</p>



    <p>As Ramdin concluded, Avan, Mrig, and Medha felt a new sense of understanding. They were a shallow 'pearl of the world' not the ocean itself. The genuine connection and the beauty of embracing the differences - that matter the most. As they were parting ways, three of them walked down the stairs. Avan noticed how in similar rhythm their footsteps fell, in a subtle harmony. "We are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike." Three of them exchanged knowing glances. Despite their differences, the shared experience of the evening, with various complex questions, had forged an invisible bond.
