    <h1 class="mb-4">A CEO, His Ex-Employee, and A Uber Ride</h1>

    <div class="card p-4">
        <p><strong>Bangalore, 1:47 AM.</strong> This city barely sleeps. It has just entered its caffeine-fueled REM cycle. Lights nearby blink and flicker on and off, like they are almost about to give up. A car's tire cuts through the rain-slick streets.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Aniket straightens his hoodie, adjusting his rearview mirror.</strong> He isn't a techie anymore, he is Uber ID BNG368425, ferrying people whose LinkedIn profiles still call them, “Senior Software Engineers.” While he is riding, for a moment he lets himself wonder if the algorithm that routes his rides can somehow sense the weight of his unspoken ambitions. Somewhere between the late-night chatter of strangers and the endless stretch of road ahead, Aniket drives - not just to earn, but to outrun the silence that sometimes creeps into his thoughts when no one is talking. The Uber app pings. Tonight, Aniket’s passenger is different.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Passenger ( CEO of a famous startup):</strong> “Airport. Ekdam fast.. I've got a board meeting.”</p>
        
        <p>The man slides into the backseat. The sharp creases of his blazer catch the dim street light outside as he shifts in his seat. The leather that is stuck to the back of his jacket, tugging slightly with each movement, demonstrates how long he has been sitting there. His phone screen lights up his face as he taps out an urgent email.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Aniket freezes.</strong> He knows that voice. He remembered him from the TechCrunch article last year - the one with the slick smile and louder opinions. It's Mr. Mehta. Aniket adjusts his rearview mirror, which is just enough to confirm.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Aniket (in his mind):</strong> “Han of course. The man who called ‘work-life balance’ a ‘millennial myth’ needs a lift now at 2 AM.</p>
        
        <p>Kapoor types furiously on his phone as the car weaves through potholes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Kapoor (without looking up):</strong> “You drivers and your shortcuts. GPS follow karo bass.”</p>
        
        <p>Aniket’s eye twitches slightly. He built the algorithm this GPS runs on - or at least he did before his last company pivoted from “AI-driven innovation” to “downsizing for profitability.”</p>
        
        <p><strong>Aniket (casually):</strong> “Sir, do you ever think about how Uber’s surge pricing affects drivers?”</p>
        
        <p>Kapoor looks up, catching the edge in Aniket’s voice - part curiosity, part defiance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Kapoor (smirking):</strong> “You guys actually use this app? Figured you’d be on Blinkit.”</p>
        
        <p><strong>Aniket (flatly):</strong> “Sir, this is my Blinkit side hustle.”</p>
        
        <p>A pause. Kapoor laughs, the kind of laugh that is specially reserved for a meeting with underpaid interns or a comedy special.</p>
        
        <p><strong>—----</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>INT. UBER - LATER</strong></p>
        
        <p>Kapoor leans forward, suddenly talkative. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Kapoor:</strong> “You’re quick. Have you ever thought about a real job? We’re hiring for customer support - work from home, 10-hour shifts, and plenty of exposure.”</p>
        
        <p>Aniket’s grip on the steering wheel tightens slightly, his knuckles turning white as he absorbs the irony.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Aniket (V.O):</strong> “Exposure.the thing broke unicorns pay you with.”</p>
        
        <p>Loud, he says, “Actually, I’m a dev. Laid off last month. Now I drive..and debug.”</p>
        
        <p>Kapoor’s phone dims mid-tweet draft. The silence between them drags on, thick and heavy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Kapoor (Awkward):</strong> “Well..the market’s tough.”</p>
        
        <p><strong>Aniket (grinning):</strong> “Tell me about it. My severance paid for one tire.”</p>
        
        <p><strong>—</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>EXT. Airport Drop-off - Dawn</strong></p>
        
        <p>Kapoor hands Aniket a 500-rupee note - no tip. He said,</p>
        
        <p>“Keep the Change. And hey - apply online! We value hustle.”</p>
        
        <p>Aniket watches him stride towards the terminal, his suitcase rolling behind him, with the confidence of someone who hasn't had to choose between rent and chai in months. Aniket checks his phone once Kapoor disappears into the crowd. A notification pops up:</p>
        
        <p><strong>UBER ALERT:</strong> “Rating: 5 Stars! Feedback: ‘Chatty, but smart for a driver.”</p>
        
        <p><strong>FADE TO BLACK.</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>POST-CREDIT SCENE:</strong> A new anonymous review on Kapoor’s Glassdoor page: “PSA: Your CEO won’t recognize you. Even after three exists.”</p>
