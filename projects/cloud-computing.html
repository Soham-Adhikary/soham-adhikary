In the 1990s it eventually reached to grid computing which was complex to set up and manage but demonstrated how multiple computers could be used to analyze vast amount of data, design complicative structures such as bridges and buildings. With Amazon, Google, and Microsoft rising at the initial years of 2000 are considered as the giant force and crucial market of the cloud. With massive data centers and offering their service to businesses of all sizes, that was a game-changer.</p>
