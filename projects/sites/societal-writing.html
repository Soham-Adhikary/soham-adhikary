                    <p> We often hear it said that committing bigger crimes can actually let you off the hook than committing the smaller ones, where on the latter ones, you'll get scapegoated for sure. I mean if you look at the instances nowadays, sentiments are totally weaponized to mess with the guys who cause trivial matters and people build connections to get out of trouble, but here's the kicker—what if you accidentally bruise the egos of those big shots at the top? And what if the smaller folks haven't fully sold their souls yet? Even if they avoid becoming those gross, manipulative monsters, they have to pay. They'll drain every last drop of your humanity, turn you into someone worse, and this cycle? Man, it just never stops.</p>

                    <p>Let's imagine, a bus accident kills two children. Driver's at fault—reckless driving. However, mere moments before the disaster, a group of random men onboard was engaged in laughter and mockery, making severe critical remarks about a certain religious belief. However, when all of this was happening, one individual, in the midst of the chaos, to act on his first thought at that moment, recorded this scene. soon that clip went viral, drawing more attention than the tragic loss of innocent lives. However, ordinary people are seen to be more bothered to focus on what provides them with meaning, purpose, belonging, and peace, topics related to religion, that was how it was the people of the society. Rightfully so, when those two lives were alive, were they contributing to any of that? Why, then, should the masses mourn their loss, right? Hah! Do these individuals, sometimes I wonder, truly push beyond their cognitive limits, the   to ignore indications of reality that are slightest, at such moments? Or do they reserve their reflections, for whatever purpose, for later?</p>

                    <p>Here's the truth: we have become desensitized, a state that no one, having a clear conscience of themselves, can deny . People would often react with more outrage at a cockroach being fed ice cream, only to be killed, rather than the murder of a human being just moments away. How sick! Also had I used a butterfly, it would have evoked, serving skewed compassion of a deeper well, an empathy that is more evident. That's very much alike a lizard, suddenly, unexpectedly falling directly into the milk would be considered a far greater tragedy than the news of yet another farmer, burdened with debt, taking their own life. Who thinks about a cockroach? Disgusting, truly, nobody. A farmer? Just another cold statistic. We're so disconnected from our own humanity that a bloody bug's last meal tugs compassion more than the screaming, crying out of desperation, actual humans beings. It's like… their pain becomes this distant, abstract thing—"eh, happens all the time." To be honest, I don't mind commenting bitingly on this self-centeredness.</p>

                    <p>Imagine if those children had worn garments that had "Jesus loves you" written over them. The focus would have shifted, significantly, toward them. The driver, until now, who was a figure of just an unfortunate circumstance in the first scene, a fate of victim of which he could hardly be made accountable of,  is now a villain, a desecrator of the sacred. As death confronts any of us, should not these distinctions fade into the background? Let's go back, for a moment, to 2015, when a male lion, named Cecil, was shot and killed by an American dentist, then, the whole world focused on Cecil specifically, obscuring, the very fact that countless other animals die every day due to various conflicts. The same we witness when wildfire happens. If a tiger is killed in the blaze, he becomes a martyr, despite countless other creatures who are vulnerable, also dying along with him, with relentlessness. We mourn the symbol, the idea of the Bagheera (the tiger), then the forest itself. We are speaking of children—innocent and vulnerable, capable of love and dreams. So why's a shirt a line between the shared grief for both? It's an irony, a garment, what is meant to unite can also divide. In reality, we'd weep harder for the symbol than the actual tragedy.</p>

                    <p>Now let's crank it up even more, shall we? What if the driver wore an inverted cross, and joked about satanism? Yep, the outrage would instantly be redirected. The mockery clip? Trivialised. Classic move right? The bigger "threat" eats the spotlight. Are we sure we're not watching a Bollywood potboiler in real life? I remember watching Chichhore last time, at first it's all academic pressure, then bam - suicide attempt. It's funny how closing the laptop, all I remember is the grand tragedy, easily forgetting the systemic pressure that drove someone to such desperation - just another Tuesday in Bollywood, and apparently, in life too. We have yet to confront the manipulation at play where narratives are curated to promote the propaganda of those in power—the truths they wish to bury for a time.Now let's crank it up even more, shall we?

Furthermore, Often we let ourselves drown in carefully crafted and selectively presented news. Why though? They only overwhelm our senses and numbs critical thinking, much like the cockroach approaching that deadly ice cream, before the stomp. Like a child being spoon-fed, we are spoon-fed The Little Mermaid fairy tales, presented carefully, selectively. Its immediacy draws our attention like moths to a flame. We are, pretty tragically, at their fingertips, and, what is worse, subtly and slowly manipulated into adopting a pseudo-reality that seeks to control, not inform.Furthermore, Often we let ourselves drown in carefully crafted and selectively presented news.

                    <p>In recent years, amidst more and more news online, the speed at which we digest them has reached alarming levels. Petty minds of ours, race across headlines, like rapid-fire, rendering us quick to judge without understanding the full context. We judge even before we understand, and scroll to the next before we reflect. Who exactly asked us to be instant 2-minute-noodle analysts? Who demands immediate wisdom in a world that rarely provides straightforward answers? Because, unlike those cockroaches, we can always pause and whisper, "Wait....does this actually make sense?" If you're wondering, taste that sugar, but taste the doubt, too. </p>
