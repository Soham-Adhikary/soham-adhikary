        <p>We often hear it said that committing bigger crimes can actually let you off the hook than committing the smaller ones. On the latter ones, you'll get scapegoated for sure. I mean if you see at the instances now-a-days, sentiments are totally weaponized to mess with the guys who cause trivial matters. People build connections to get out of trouble, but here's the kicker—what if you accidentally bruise the egos of those big shots at the top? And what if the smaller folks haven't fully sold their souls yet? Even if they avoid becoming those gross, manipulative monsters, they have to pay. They'll drain every last drop of your humanity, turn you into someone worse, and this cycle? Man, it just never stops.</p>

        <p>Let's imagine, a bus accident kills two children. Driver's at fault—reckless driving. However, mere moments before the disaster, a group of random men onboard was engaged in laughter and mockery, making severe critical remarks about a certain religious belief. One individual, in the midst of the chaos, recorded this scene, and soon that clip went viral, drawing more attention than the tragic loss of innocent lives. However, ordinary people are more bothered to focus on what provides them with meaning, purpose, belonging, and peace, topics related to religion. Rightfully so, when those two lives were alive, were they contributing to any of that? Why, then, should the masses mourn their loss, right? Hah! Do these individuals truly push beyond their cognitive limits to ignore even the slightest indications of reality at such moments? Or do they reserve their reflections for later?</p>

        <p>Here's the truth: we have become desensitized. People would often react with more outrage at a cockroach being fed ice cream, only to be killed, rather than the murder of a human being just moments away. Had I used a butterfly, it would have evoked greater empathy for sure. That's very much alike a lizard falling straight into the milk would be considered far greater tragedy than the news of yet another farmer committing suicide due to debt. Who thinks about a cockroach? Disgusting, nobody. A farmer? Just another statistic. We're so disconnected from our own humanity that a bug's last meal tugs compassion more than actual humans screaming. It's like… their pain becomes this distant, abstract thing—"eh, happens all the time."</p>

        <p>Imagine if those children had worn garments that had "Jesus loves you" written over them. The focus would have tended to shift so significantly toward them. The driver, until now, who was a figure of just an unfortunate circumstance in the first scene, is now a villain, a desecrator of the sacred. As death confronts any of us, should not these distinctions fade into the background? Lets go back to 2015, when a male lion, named Cecil, was shot and killed by an American dentist. The whole world focused on Cecil specifically, overshadowing the very fact that countless other animals die every day due to various conflicts. Same we witness when wildfire happens. If a tiger is killed in the blaze, he becomes the martyr, despite countless other creatures also died along with him. We mourn the symbol, the idea of the Bangheera (the tiger), than the forest itself. We are speaking of children—innocent and vulnerable, capable of love and dreams. So why's a shirt a line between the shared grief for both? It's an irony, a garment, what is meant to unite can also divide. In reality, we'd weep harder for the symbol than the actual tragedy.</p>
