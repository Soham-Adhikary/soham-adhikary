                    <p> We often hear it said that committing bigger crimes can actually let you off the hook than committing the smaller ones. On the latter ones, you'll get scapegoated for sure. I mean if you look at the instances nowadays, sentiments are totally weaponized to mess with the guys who cause trivial matters. People build connections to get out of trouble, but here's the kicker—what if you accidentally bruise the egos of those big shots at the top? And what if the smaller folks haven't fully sold their souls yet? Even if they avoid becoming those gross, manipulative monsters, they have to pay. They'll drain every last drop of your humanity, turn you into someone worse, and this cycle? Man, it just never stops.</p>

                    <p>Let's imagine, a bus accident kills two children. Driver's at fault—reckless driving. However, mere moments before the disaster, a group of random men onboard was engaged in laughter and mockery, making severe critical remarks about a certain religious belief. One individual, in the midst of the chaos, recorded this scene, and soon that clip went viral, drawing more attention than the tragic loss of innocent lives. However, ordinary people are more bothered to focus on what provides them with meaning, purpose, belonging, and peace, topics related to religion. Rightfully so, when those two lives were alive, were they contributing to any of that? Why, then, should the masses mourn their loss, right? Hah! Do these individuals truly push beyond their cognitive limits to ignore even the slightest indications of reality at such moments? Or do they reserve their reflections for later?</p>

                    <p>Here's the truth: we have become desensitized. People would often react with more outrage at a cockroach being fed ice cream, only to be killed, rather than the murder of a human being just moments away. How sick! Also had I used a butterfly, it would have evoked greater empathy for sure. That's very much alike a lizard from out of nowhere falling straight into the milk would be considered a far greater tragedy than the news of yet another farmer committing suicide due to debt. Who thinks about a cockroach? Disgusting, nobody. A farmer? Just another statistic. We're so disconnected from our own humanity that a bloody bug's last meal tugs compassion more than actual humans screaming. It's like… their pain becomes this distant, abstract thing—"eh, happens all the time."</p>

                    <p>Imagine if those children had worn garments that had "Jesus loves you" written over them. The focus would have tended to shift so significantly toward them. The driver, until now, who was a figure of just an unfortunate circumstance in the first scene, is now a villain, a desecrator of the sacred. As death confronts any of us, should not these distinctions fade into the background? Let's go back to 2015, when a male lion, named Cecil, was shot and killed by an American dentist. The whole world focused on Cecil specifically, overshadowing the very fact that countless other animals die every day due to various conflicts. The same we witness when wildfire happens. If a tiger is killed in the blaze, he becomes a martyr, despite countless other creatures also dying along with him. We mourn the symbol, the idea of the Bagheera (the tiger), then the forest itself. We are speaking of children—innocent and vulnerable, capable of love and dreams. So why's a shirt a line between the shared grief for both? It's an irony, a garment, what is meant to unite can also divide. In reality, we'd weep harder for the symbol than the actual tragedy.</p>

                    <p>Now let's crank it up even more, shall we? What if the driver wore an inverted cross, and joked about satanism? Yep, the outrage would quickly be redirected. The mockery clip? Trivialised. Classic move right? The bigger "threat" eats the spotlight. Are we sure we're not watching a Bollywood potboiler in real life? I remember watching Chichhore last time, at first it's all academic pressure, then bam - suicide attempt. It's funny how closing the laptop, all I remember is the grand tragedy, easily forgetting the systemic pressure that drove someone to such desperation - just another Tuesday in Bollywood, and apparently, in life too. We have yet to confront the manipulation at play where narratives are curated to promote the propaganda of those in power—the truths they wish to bury for a time.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, Often we let ourselves drown in carefully crafted and selectively presented news. Why though? They only overwhelm our senses and numbs critical thinking, much like the cockroach approaching that deadly ice cream, before the stomp. Like a child being spoon-fed, we are spoon-fed The Little Mermaid fairy tales, carefully and selectively presented. Its immediacy draws our attention like moths to a flame. We are at their fingertips, manipulated into adopting a pseudo-reality that seeks to control rather than inform.</p>

                    <p>In recent years, the speed at which we digest news has reached alarming levels. Petty minds of race across headlines, like rapid-fire, rendering us quick to judge without understanding the full context. We judge even before we understand, and scroll to the next before we reflect. Who exactly asked us to be instant 2-minute-noodle analysts? Who demands immediate wisdom in a world that rarely provides straightforward answers? Because, unlike those cockroaches, we can always pause and whisper, "Wait....does this actually make sense?" If you're wondering, taste that sugar, but taste the doubt, too. </p>
