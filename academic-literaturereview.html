    <div class="card p-4">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>For many researchers, the literature review nowadays has become a graveyard of dead quotes, often being perceived as the most tedious and formulaic component of academic writing. It has become mere summaries of existing work that fail to engage readers or contribute meaningfully to scholarly discourse. Most of the time they are criticized for being uninspired and riddled with plagiarism. A literature review should not merely summarize existing work but should analyze and synthesize it. As academic writing expert Dr. Jane Smith notes, "A literature review should be a dynamic conversation, not a static recitation of facts." This article presents a strategic and mindful approach to make a literature review which becomes notable, attracting many citations and serving as fundamental research endeavors.</p>

        <h2>Execution Plan: How to Make a High-Impact Literature Review?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Choosing a Hot Niche</h3>
                <p>Researchers should focus on emerging interdisciplinary sections instead of tackling an overly broad or saturated field. It's crucial to select a niche that is both timely and relevant to ensure our review resonates with scholars and practitioners alike. For example, a topic like “AI in Ayurveda.” could be considered. Researchers could use co-citation analysis to identify active debate zones and underexplored pages. Bibliometric tools like VOSviewer and CiteSpace allow researchers to visualize emerging trends and citation networks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Crafting Engaging Debates Through “Citation Triangles”</h3>
                <p>“Author A said X, Author B said Y”, linear narration, is known as a common flaw in literature reviews. High-impact reviews employ dialectical structuring, where sources are positioned in intellectual conflict.</p>
                <p>“While A (2023) argues that AI diagnostics improve Ayurvedic accuracy, B (2024) counters that algorithmic bias skews results. However, C (2024) introduces a hybrid human-AI validation framework, resolving this tension.” This technique consists of three studies that involve contradiction, evolution, and synthesis. It complex citation because later researchers must engage with the framed debate rather than isolated claims.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Demonstrating Impact Through Real-Time Citations</h3>
                <p>Once the literature review is published, it is very essential to monitor its impact, Google Scholar alerts becoming a powerful tool in this regard. Using LSI (Latent Semantic keywords) naturally throughout the text and including long-tail academic search phrases can help optimize for semantic searching. Moreover, actively promoting your review through academic networks enhances visibility while engaging with them directly fosters collaboration opportunities and increases the chances of reciprocal citations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Developing a “Lit Review Upgrade Kit”</h3>
                <p>Once your literature review is published, to ensure that it is both comprehensive and well-organized, tracking its impact becomes crucial. This kit can include tools such as Zotero tags to categorize and manage your references, as well as examples from Scite.ai that highlight both good and bad citation practices. Pre-designed frameworks help you keep everything together when you're juggling lots of different ideas.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Researchers can produce reviews that actively shape their fields by selecting high-potential niches, structuring debates through citation triangles, and leveraging bibliographic tools. The result? A manuscript that is cited, debated, and built upon, elevates your review from mediocrity to excellence. As academics, our goal isn't just to document existing knowledge, rather we aim to challenge it and redefine it. Because, in the end, our literature review has the potential to become a magnet for citations, it can do more than just summarize. And that's a testament to its enduring relevance and influence.</p>
